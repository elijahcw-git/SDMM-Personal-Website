Summary

Task 1 of Software Development Mastermind, a mentoring program ran by Andy Sterkowitz is to create a very basic website. The website includes a homepage with a centered photo and text. Additionally, it contains a contact page with a fake phone number in email. Both webpages contain a navigation bar, which changes color to show your current page. It will also change background and font color when the mouse is hovering over the page link in the navbar.
